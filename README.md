    This is a frontend from scratch project for a fictional museum. The goal of this project is to create a website that is responsive and accessible. The website is supposed to take the user to a different world and make them feel like they are in a museum. We built the website to take on some new challenges, such as learn a new JavaScript Library (Three.js) and firebase to host a website. We had a lot of fun building this website and we hope you enjoy it!
